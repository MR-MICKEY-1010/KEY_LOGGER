🔐 Keylogger – Educational Cybersecurity Project
📌 Overview

This repository contains an educational keylogger project developed to help cybersecurity students and professionals understand how keystroke logging techniques work from an attacker’s perspective so they can detect, analyze, and defend against them.

The project is designed strictly for learning, ethical hacking labs, malware analysis, and blue-team defense research.

⚠️ Legal & Ethical Disclaimer

This project is for educational and authorized security research only.
Running or deploying a keylogger on any system without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.
